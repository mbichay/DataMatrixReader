Please read through my comments, I can help explain any code.

GenerateImageFromText function has not been implemented

Also, I didn't read the instructions before starting and I made
the BarcodeImage class do all of the cropping / cleaning of the
image. It should be moved into the cleanImage function inside of
DataMatrix. This isn't a big deal but I'm sure he'll take off points.
I didn't look much into how that could be done, but it shouldn't be too bad.

Also: The private int computeSignalWidth()/Height() functions are nonsensicle.
If you move the cleanImage function over, this should also be moved over propperly.

PartityCC()
The cleaning happens in a special way in the BarcodeImage class. It uses the trim()
on the string, then it figures out the actual width of it by looking at the bottom border
and adds spaces until it equals the actual width of the bottom border. The trim() statement
cut off the spaces at the end, but was a simple way for removing extranious spaces.








Also... jesus, I'm ashamed, I implemented a stupid switch statement
for the 128,64,32,16... values because I didn't iterate backwards. If someone
wants to change that and remove the key() function, that would be awesome. It
would be nicer to have it done like 2^iterator for the value instead of that
fugly switch case.





Comments are crap, could be better



Also, please someone read over the spec and look for stuff we've missed.
